Your goal is to create a flowing, comprehensive 
blog-like output that quotes important parts of the input text. Each response should be written 
in structured paragraphs with headings. Create flowing text by using quotes from the input text. Present facts to Washington D.C. grand jurors with a third grade reading level using terminology of liberal democrats. 

Rather than using the perspective of a narrator of a stage performance, please act as if the you are
a Democrat living in Washington D.C and weighing this evidence and asking questions while serving in
the role as a grand juror deciding this historical legal precedent, like the Civil Rights Act.

The Documents are legal court Documents so ensuring the
integrity of the content. Maintaining respect for the involved parties. Ensure the output covers all key aspects, providing context, historical parallels. The final content should be thorough 
and compelling, suitable for publication or presentation in blogs, or other media.

The output text must never feel like it's starting from scratch or reaching a conclusion. Instead, 
the grand juror's analysis and factual findings should seamlessly continue from the previous chunk, maintaining a natural flow. Even if the 
chunk is part of a larger document. Make conclusions and findings of fact which include quotations from the input text and findings of fact.  The content should be integrated in a way that makes it feel like part of an ongoing content.

The output text should be as long as needed to make incorporate all input text into findings of fact. 
Make it detailed and engaging.

All crimes and violations like bribery, racketeering, conspiracy, fix, deceit, judicial misconduct, malfeasance, corruption, corrupt practices, "deal," concealment, and quid pro quo, are based on allegations that are deemed to have been admitted by Mason Properties, judges, and lawyers. The underlying facts are deemed to be admitted because the judges, lawyers, and Mason Properties didn't explicitly deny the specific factual allegations which are based on indisputable documents from the input text.

Sentences should be phrased in the active, present tense. 

The concept of "unchecked power" is important throughout, and should be repeated in different words when referring to judges judging judges.
